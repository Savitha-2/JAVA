Method Overloading


Method overloading means having multiple methods with the same name in the same class,
but with different parameter lists.

Java decides which method to call at compile time, 
so it is an example of compile-time polymorphism.


Rules of Method Overloading

Methods must differ by at least one of the following:

* Number of parameters

* Type of parameters

* Order of parameters

❌ Changing only the return type is NOT allowed.
