How Java Works

Java is a platform-independent, secure, and memory-managed language.

Here’s how it works step by step:

1️⃣ Write Java Code (.java)

Write your program in a .java file:

class Hello {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        System.out.println("Hello Java!");
    }
}


This is called Source Code.

2️⃣ Compile Code → Bytecode (.class)

Use the Java compiler:

javac Hello.java


Creates a .class file

Contains bytecode (platform-independent instructions)

3️⃣ JVM Loads the Bytecode

Run the program:

java Hello


JVM (Java Virtual Machine) loads the .class file and prepares it for execution.

Class Loader: Loads code and libraries

Bytecode Verifier: Checks for errors or unsafe code

4️⃣ JVM Converts Bytecode → Machine Code

JVM uses Interpreter + JIT (Just-In-Time) Compiler

Converts bytecode into CPU-understandable machine code

Repeated code is optimized for faster execution

5️⃣ CPU Executes Machine Code

The CPU runs the program

Output is produced on the screen
